# EPI-Solutions-in-Go
this is a simple implementation of the solutions with basic test inside the main function
for a more complete implementation see stefan tudose repo at https://github.com/stefantds/go-epi-solutions/tree/master. 
although the code structure, tests, and the go version EPI judge are great, alot of the soutions in stefan's repo don't have 
the best runtime or space complexity, hence this repo tries to collect the solutions with more or less the best results.
