# EPI-Solutions-in-Go
This repository provides straightforward Go implementations of problems from Elements of Programming Interviews (EPI), each accompanied by basic tests directly embedded in the main function.

For a more comprehensive and modular collection, check out Stefan Tudoseâ€™s repo. His project features robust structure, thorough test coverage, and integrates with the Go version of the EPI judge. see https://github.com/stefantds/go-epi-solutions/tree/master. 

## Although the code structure, tests, and the go version EPI judge are great, alot of the soutions in stefan's repo don't have 
the best runtime or space complexity, hence this repo tries to collect the solutions with more or less the best results.
